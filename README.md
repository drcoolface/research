# ABSTRACT

Accurate weather forecasting is critical for a wide range of applications, from agriculture and transportation to disaster management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), have shown promise of improving the accuracy of various sequence-to-sequence processing tasks, such as Natural Language Processing and prediction models. In this study, a comparative analysis has been conducted for LSTM and GRU with encoder-decoder models using hourly MERRA-2 data to predict the temperature and humidity for prediction windows of 5 hours, 10 hours, and 20 hours. The results indicate that for a prediction window of 5 and 10 hours, both the models performed similarly, albeit LSTM performed slightly better. However, for the 20- hour window, LSTM performed significantly better. The results also indicate that errors in forecasted values increased with the increment of output prediction hour window.
